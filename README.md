# Nimble

A collection of quick, practical tools for daily data transformation and manipulation tasks. This app is designed for functionality over aesthetics - simple tools that get the job done efficiently.

## What is Nimble?

Nimble is a toolkit of straightforward utilities that help with common data processing tasks. It's not meant to be beautiful or showcase-worthy, but rather to be a reliable set of tools you can count on when you need to quickly transform or filter data.

## Available Tools

### CSV Substitution Tool
Transform CSV data using pattern substitution with numbered placeholders like `{0}`, `{1}`, `{2}`, etc. Perfect for quickly reformatting data or creating SQL queries from CSV files.

### Line Removal Tool
Remove lines from text that contain specific IDs. Useful for filtering scripts, log files, or any text data where you need to exclude entries based on a list of identifiers.

This app follows a "function over form" approach:
- **Simple and direct**: No unnecessary complexity
- **Fast and reliable**: Tools that work when you need them
- **Practical focus**: Each tool solves a real, common problem
- **Minimal UI**: Clean interfaces that don't get in the way
